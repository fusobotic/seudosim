# Animations needed:
- Player idle(s) for NPCs: Bored, Nervous, Eager, 
- Trigger pull(s)
- Click relief
- Take drink
- Death by bullet
- Death by drink
- Winning

- Sexy shop owner animation?

Drink ideas (maybe just have whole bottles so that the liquid isn’t obvious), or just animate the water level somehow.

# Camera animations: 

Keeps calm and somewhat stable at first,
Get’s more terrified/suspenseful as game continues
More lerpy/sluggish according to intoxication
Really rapid jerking whenever player wins or lose

# Shop Stats:
Make shopkeep sexy and click-bait style to parody other free to play games. Ability to buy shopkeep w/ real money?

Courage up means more likely to be shot (actually modifies the AI’s random value up one or two)

Cowardice means shot index is reduced on AI (more likely to shoot himself first)

Luck up, does nothing, or actually could modify drinking capacity
