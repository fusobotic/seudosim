# Abstract 

_Seudosim_ (working title), is a parody of addictive, repetitive mechanics present in most single-tap-oriented skinner box mobile games. It presents the same basic mechanics in a morbid, self-aware atmosphere. The main mechanic is participating in competitive Russian Roulette matches, wherein the player can earn money to buy better accessories that may or may not effect gameplay in meaningful ways (descriptions of items could be false advertising). While the initial interaction is basic- putting up a bet, loading a cartridge, spinning the cylinder, and taking turns pulling the trigger- certain subtle actions like keeping track of the rotations, whether the hammer is back and other body language allows the player to tip the scale in their favor. An end game may or may not be implemented (boss battle?).


# Characters

Main character - we never see his/her face, only back of head. Various accessories will be displayed. Doesn’t show any emotion. Has very linear animation. Silent protagonist for the most part

Test Dummy - Blank face with burn marks and cracks. Has empty white eyes and smiley face. Used for prototyping and player practice.

I have a few more sketches of characters who I will flesh out later (having different approaches to games, slightly different animations etc)


# Main gameplay mechanic

1. Player will start by placing a bet on the game in the form of coins, which will be money lost if match is lost. Money not lost will be given in last will and testament to _next generation_ (have some sort of funny counter for this in the info section or something).

2. Next step is dragging bullet(s) bought into the chamber, how many put in will determine difficulty and pay out (though this might just be made into a different game mode).

3. Cylinder is placed/snapped back into weapon, and rotated. This rotation could either happen by tapping once (for a random value) or have acceleration relative to player swipe, which might be hard to figure out. During this rotation a click will be played after every chamber (every 60 degrees rotation). This will allow players to keep relative track of bullet locations but in a more challenging way than looking at the chambers. Since one of the main themes of the game is deception, bluffing etc, the hammer may be pulled back before, during or after cylinder rotation, since this cancels out the 60 degree rotation that normally happens during a dual action trigger pull.

4. The cylinder will stop, giving the player a brief moment to pull the hammer back before transitioning to an over-the-shoulder view of both participants in the game. It’s up to the player/AI as to which player pulls first, sort of like an old western standoff. After the first pull each alternates, the camera indicating which player is up. (Might add more time to the trigger pull depending on whether it’s in single/double action since double requires more pressure, which could add more nuance to body language between players)

5. If opponent dies, money rains over the screen, a child-like yay sound is played and it transitions back to the menu. If player dies, a loud bang noise is played for an instant before going straight to black. Black fades in the game logo which has both black and red lettering. Either outcome transitions back to the either the main menu or another match depending on game mode.


# Game Modes

(might cull some of these depending on time, they’re just ideas at this point… will have to test to see if they’re worth including)

- Stationary Cylinder: allows players to strategically place bullets

- Classic Dual: Both players have a revolver, standoff then alternate. Survivor wins.

- Classic Single: One revolver, player loads, starts with AI or player randomly. Revolver is passed back and forth

- Wimp Dual: Like Classic only cylinder is rotated/hammer pulled back between shots.

- Wimp Single: Like Classic but cylinder rotated.

- Freeform: No rules, any bullets, whoever dies first loses.

- Assuicide: Like freeform, only one bullet, first person to die wins.
